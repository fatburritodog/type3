            <h2>Why is this happening to my kid?</h2>
            <p>It can be hard to pin point an exact reason. However, many youth engage in cyberbullying to get revenge for something someone else did first. Make sure that your kids know they can come to you and discuss issues
                they are having with peers (offline or online). Give kids the opportunity and skillset to solve interpersonal problems in appropriate ways, instead of resorting to revenge.

            <h2>How can I be more open to my child about this?</h2>
            <p>Keep an open line of communication. Understand the root of the problem. We hear that “hurt people hurt people.” It is critical to identify the reason(s) your child has acted out. Is it an unhealthy
                way of coping with stress in their life? Because they themselves are being victimized? Because there are no rules in place, and no threat of sanctions to deter them? Try to get to the bottom of the issue.
