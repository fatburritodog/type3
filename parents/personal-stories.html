          “I love my daughter.<br>

        <p>When Steve turned 14, he was allowed to make his first email and Facebook
account. Around 4 months into the account, classmates began to harass him
slowly by mocking his statuses and photos. Once they discovered Steves’s
sexuality, they began to out him all over social media and the bullying only
increased tenfold. Unsure if what to do, Steve would just let the abuse come
in. It wasn’t until he was 15 that he shared his experience with his friends. His
friends urged him to share this information with his parents.</p>
        <p>"I’m comfortable with who I am,” Steve says. “It's my truth and no one can
take that away from me. It's my story." </p>
